# Number-Guessing-Game
This project is a **Java-based Number Guessing Game** with a **Swing UI**, where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between **1 and 100**. The game provides real-time feedback, tracks the number of attempts, and ensures a smooth user experience.  

The tech stack includes **Java** for game logic and UI, **Swing (JOptionPane)** for user interaction, and **Random Number Generation** to create a unique number for each session.  

Key features include user input validation, interactive feedback (**Too High / Too Low / Correct**), and attempt tracking to measure performance. The Swing UI provides a simple yet engaging interface using dialog boxes for input and responses. Planned enhancements include difficulty levels, graphical UI improvements, and leaderboard tracking.  

The game logic generates a random number and continuously prompts the user until they find the correct answer. Attempt tracking is handled within the program to count the number of guesses.  

To run the project, **clone the repository**, compile the Java file, and execute the program using a Java IDE such as **IntelliJ or Eclipse**, or run it via the command line using `javac` and `java`. No external dependencies are required, making it lightweight and easy to set up.
